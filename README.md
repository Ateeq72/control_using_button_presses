#Controlling different tasks using single button!
by ateeq72@xda
a huge thanks to gordon77@raspberrypi.org

This is a Python code for RPi which can be used to control 1,2,3.. different specific
tasks just by using clicks of a button! i.e one press performs a task and double
performs other and so on! what tasks it performs can be seen using the code itself! :D

Thank You! :)
