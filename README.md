#Controlling different tasks using single button!
by ateeq72@xda
a huge thanks to gordon77@raspberrypi.org

This is a Python code for RPi which can be used to control 1,2,3.. different specific
tasks just by using clicks of a button! i.e one press performs a task and double
performs other and so on! what tasks it performs can be seen using the code itself! :D

This code uses a file named "status" in the directory /home/pi/Piracast/<here>
using which it identifies the current environment!. Thus for the first time you manually
have to edit this file with appropriate value i.e 0 or 1. save it with 1 if you are
sure that the pi is in Piracast mode i.e WiFi-Direct mode or 0 if not!. Just after
editing it for the first time!. The code will automatically take it from their!


Thank You! :)
